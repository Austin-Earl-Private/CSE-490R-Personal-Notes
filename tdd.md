-   What advantages as a developer does TDD provide?
-   Fewer bugs and errors are the primary benefit of the TDD approach. When the code has fewer bugs, you'll spend less time fixing them than other programming methodologies. TDD produces a higher overall test coverage and, therefore to a better quality of the final product https://fortegrp.com/test-driven-development-benefits/#:~:text=Developers%20have%20less%20debugging%20to,quality%20of%20the%20final%20product.
-   What steps do I do to implement TDD?
-   1. Write A Test
-   2. Start The Test
-   3. Refine The Code
-   4. Repeat The Process
-   This entails that a person creates a test and fixes the code till the test passes. If it passes, then you are good to work on another part.
-   What tools or software can I use to do unit testing?
-   Junit (JAVA)
-   NUnit (.Net)
-   DBUnit (Databases java)
-   HTMLUnit (Test HTML)
-   PHPUnit (Test PHP with Junit)
-   Jest (Javascript Testing)
-   Karma (Frontend Testing)
